# Himank Database Server

This repo is for setting multiple databases in one server using Docker & Docker Compose.

## Why this?

There are multiple service providers with different pricing and billing with every database,
so it becomes difficult to manage all these when you are doing only a development project or to do any side project with very little database use. So here, I have made a single `docker-compose.yml` file that can set up all the databases required for development in various small projects in one place.

## Databases

### MySQL

### PostgreSQL

### Redis
